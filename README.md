Dear World

My name is Cian. 
I work with information.
I like to structure information. 
I like to make patterns from information. 
I like when information is well organised. 
I like patterns everywhere in life, patterns are organisation - and organisation helps us to find what we need faster. 
Patterns can also provide context, when working with information context is important. 
Context helps us to make sense of the information that we are consuming. 
If information does not make sense, where does that leave us? What's the opposite of sense?
